## Angry Birds Game
First Semester – University Project

## Overview
This project is a team-based academic assignment focused on developing a simplified version of the Angry Birds game using the C++ programming language.
The goal of this project is to apply fundamental programming concepts in a practical environment while improving logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

## Project Description
This project is developed as the final project for the Fundamentals of Programming course during the first academic semester.
The main objective is to implement the core mechanics of the Angry Birds game in C++, including user interaction, timing control, and simple game logic.

In addition to programming fundamentals, the project emphasizes teamwork, structured code organization, and the use of Git and GitHub to simulate a real-world collaborative development environment.

## Learning Objectives
- Applying fundamental programming concepts in C++
- Understanding basic game logic and program flow
- Improving problem-solving skills
- Practicing team-based software development
- Using Git and GitHub for version control

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C++
- Version Control System: Git
- Collaboration Platform: GitHub

## Libraries Used
- iostream

  including Library:
  ```cpp
  #include <iostream>
  ```
  This library is used for standard input and output.

  ---
- thread

  including Library:
  ```cpp
  #include <thread>
  ```
  This library is used to create a time pause between two movements.
  
  ---
- chrono
  
  including Library:
  ```cpp
  #include <chrono>
  ```
  This library is used for measuring time.
  
  ---
- fstream
  
  including Library:
  ```cpp
  #include <fstream>
  ```
  This library is designed for working with files.
  Example in the code:
  ```cpp
  ifstream file("abn.txt");
  ```
  
  ---
- windows.h
  
  including Library:
  ```cpp
  #include <windows.h>
  ```
  This library is used to control keyboard input.
  In the windows.h library, each keyboard key has a code, and this library allows you to return the code of that key by pressing a key on the keyboard.

  ---
- conio.h
  
  including Library:
  ```cpp
  #include <fstream>
  ```
