## Angry Birds Game  
First Semester – University Project

## Overview
This project is a team-based academic assignment aimed at developing a simplified version of the *Angry Birds* game using the C++ programming language.  
The purpose of this project is to apply fundamental programming concepts in a practical environment while gaining experience in structured problem-solving and basic game logic implementation.

## Project Description
This project is developed as a final project for the Fundamentals of Programming course during the first academic semester.  
The main objective is to implement the core mechanics of the Angry Birds game in C++, focusing on essential programming principles such as conditional statements, loops, functions, arrays, and basic input/output operations.

In addition to programming concepts, the project emphasizes teamwork, code organization, and the use of version control systems to simulate a real-world collaborative development environment.
